# ðŸ’» Sockets Programming - Creating a Client Server Model 

To test out the code yourself clone the remote repository and effectly type the following commands in your terminal. 
```
make 
./bin/server 
./bin/client
``` 

This effectively compiles the souce code into a intermediate files called object files and then gets passed to the linker and creates executable files. 
When running the server and client executable on your local machine, open up 3 live terminal and write 1 terminal with the server executable and the other two with the client executable. 

In doing so you can have a toy communication application in yours local machine.
